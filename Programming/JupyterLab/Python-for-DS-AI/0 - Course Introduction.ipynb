    "* My name is Chaklam.  Born Hong Kong.  Research Interests on Neurosciene, Brain Computer Interfaces, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Human Computer Interaction.  Welcome you all!  This course will be fun and tough!\n",
    "\n",
    "* All materials can be found on my **Github - https://github.com/chaklam-silpasuwanchai/**.  If you forget, you can also get the link from http://chaklam.com\n",
    "\n",
    "* I am sitting in **room 203** most of the time.  You are very welcomed to meet me in person.  In fact, I want anyone of you to visit me and ask question, instead of just feeling stressed.  There is no need of appointment - but if you need like 3 hours of talk, you can send emails to my calendar - chaklam@ait.asia\n",
    "\n",
    "* Room 203 also has many machine learning books I used for this class.  You are not allowed to take them away - but you are certainly welcomed to read them at my lab mini library.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For online folks, you can always schedule a zoom meeting with me by sending me emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introducing our TA, Mr. Akrardet (Jo) - st121413@ait.asia  PhD. students in my lab working on brain computer interfaces.  He will be in charge of\n",

    "### Setting up your Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "* I use **python3** as interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will be using a lot of modules that may not be pre-built in python, so I assume you know how to use pip to install missing modules.   I also assume you use linux systems since I have no experience in Windows :)  Read Lab 0 if you haven't.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Highly recommend to use **venv** to setup your python environment, before installing python modules.  If you do not know how and what is venv, read this.  https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.  Docker is welcomed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sometimes, it will take like several hours (like 3 to 4 hours) to run your model.  CSIM has some resources which you can use to help your model train faster.  One is the puffer system.  You can access it using https://puffer.cs.ait.ac.th  (in CSIM), which got four 2080Tis, 64GBs Ram, and very powerful CPU (I don't remember the series).  You must use your CSIM account to access and has been allocated a certain space amount.  Note that ~jovyan/ is all temporary, going away when the user's server is shut down. ~jovyan/work is persistent.   All notebooks are automatically stored in /work so do not worry your file will be lost.   The current server is a work-in-progress so make sure you backup!  There are also some PCs you can use at CSIM lab which has one NVIDIA 2060 super, i7, so that's plenty for you to run your model as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Math is not required and will be taught just enough for you to code your own SVM, etc.** I will be providing 9 hours related to Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Stats. This course is best taken together with Machine Learning with Prof. Matthew Dailey, where you can study the full derivation of formulas.  For your own deeper study, I recommend the followings:\n",
    "    - Linear Algebra short recap - https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/15-884/linalg-review.pdf;  Recommended book - http://linear.axler.net; Recommended playlist (Prof. Gilbert Strang) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UJ4CFRGd-U&list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8\n",
    "    - Stats - http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/ (free!)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very practical course.  **Intermediate level**. Could be slightly difficult for those without any programming experience, but I will try my best to explain almost everything slowly and clearly as possible.  I will work very hard and I also hope the same for your side.\n",

Assignments are there for you to \"learn\" and \"practice\", not for you to \"suffer\".    And I will review every assignment on due date about 10-15 minutes of the beginning of the classes.  My recommendation is try to form a study group and enjoy spending time together fighting these assignments - it's more fun than working alone, that's for sure!"
